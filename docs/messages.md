to move to different pages if there are more messages than fit on single page.

Submitting news

On the right side are controls that are used to submit news. These user

delivering it to everyone in the faction.

Sometimes there are special events that require decision to be made. Any
memeber of the faction can choose which course of action should be taken by
clicking the corresponding title. Underneath of the title likely results are
explained. Event is then resolved at the end of current turn. Sometimes
one turn is enough to take care of the event, while other times the same event
might linger for multiple turns. In any case, as long as the choices are
visible, player can change their decision.
